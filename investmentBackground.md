## Objectives
This project was created to determine whether certain investment strategies were more successful than others given a certain length of time, based on historical data. 


## Investment Background
Most "intelligent" investment strategies as defined by Benjamin Graham in his famous work, *The Intelligent Investor* heavily emphasize the *dollar cost averaging* (DCA) strategy.

### Dollar Cost Averaging
For those unfamiliar with the term, *dollar cost averaging* is the strategy used by investors where they invest a fixed amount of money into the market on regular intervals, regardless of whether the market is doing well or not.

Thus, when the market is bullish, the typical DCA investor would buy a few shares of a given stock, and when the market is bearish, the investor would buy more shares than usual of a given stock.

The rational behind this strategy is that the investor would be able to ride bull markets without fearing its end, and weather bear markets with the assumption that the market will eventually recover and reward the investor for their diligence.

However, this type of strategy assumes that most markets eventually recover to allowing shares purchased during bull markets to profit, despite bear markets. Historically, this has been true for some markets such as the US SP500 and the British FTSE100, but in other foreign markets, such as the Japanese Nikkei, Chinese Shanghai Index, and the European EuroStoxx50, markets have never fully recovered since their peaks in the early 2000s. 

Given the realities of many markets not fully recovering in the near future, another strategy maybe more appropriate to fully take advantage of bull markets and also avoid losses during bear markets: momentum trading.


### Momentum Trading
Given the hypothesis that rising markets will continue to rise until they crash, momentum trading seeks to "ride" bull markets after markets exhibit a rising behavior and once markets start faltering, funds will be reallocated to more stable forms of investment such as bonds. 

Indicators used for such trading are typically 200 day moving averages. If the current price is above the current 200 moving average, the investor should buy, and if the price is below the current 200 moving average, the investor should transfer their investment into bonds.

This strategy is usually described in lump-sum fashion, where the investor will typically buy or sell all of their funds immediately if the price goes below or above the indicator respectively.

### Question
However, given these two different strategies, I have started to wonder if a hybrid strategy of sorts would be more effective. Buying and selling via the momentum strategy to avoid significant losses is generally a conservative, safe decision, but given a regular flow funds from my occupation, how should I deal with the monthly influx of money? Should I simply lump sum at the start of the year? Should I continue to buy even as the current price is below the current moving average? Or should I funnel such funds into bonds while the market is bearish?

These are the questions I seek to answer with this project.
