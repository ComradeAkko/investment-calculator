## Objectives
This project was created to determine whether certain investment strategies were more successful than others given a certain length of time, based on historical data.

Pandas is already known to be a good data reader, but I want to try creating a data reader and analyzer from the ground up, so I won't be using it. 


## Disclaimer
I'm definitely not by any means an experienced investor or a coder, so my results may not be entirely accurate. Furthermore, past market results generally are not indicative of any future results, so any historical data I find may not apply to the future.
